This project is a Flask RESTful API for managing customer requests for a service-based company. The API allows clients to do CRUD operations on their data, including creating new requests, retrieving existing requests, updating request details, and deleting requests. The API is designed to be scalable and secure, with proper authentication and validation mechanisms in place.

The API is hosted on pythonanywhere.com, providing easy access for clients to interact with the service from anywhere. The project follows best practices for RESTful API design, ensuring that endpoints are intuitive and responses are well-structured.

It has JWT-based authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate their data. Input validation is implemented to maintain data integrity and prevent malicious inputs.

Users can register and log in to the system, after which they can create, view, update, and delete their service requests. Each request includes details such as the request type, description, status, and timestamps for creation and updates.

The core business is around customers that can create-upload the details of their restaurant's menu. A menu il a list of dishes that the restaurant offers, and each dish has a series of attributes. The company receives these menus and processes them to generate music playlists that enhance the dining experience based on cross-modal scientific studies.
